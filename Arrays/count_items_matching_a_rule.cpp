                   Count Items Matching a Rule
                   
  https://leetcode.com/problems/count-items-matching-a-rule/
  
  
  You are given an array items, where each items[i] = [typei, colori, namei] describes the type, color, and name of the ith item. You are also given a rule represented by two strings, ruleKey and ruleValue.
  The ith item is said to match the rule if one of the following is true:

  ruleKey == "type" and ruleValue == typei.
  ruleKey == "color" and ruleValue == colori.
  ruleKey == "name" and ruleValue == namei.
  Return the number of items that match the given rule.
